# Maxwell Edwards

<img src="./images/banner-rounded.png" alt="banner that says Maxwell Edwards - Software Engineer">

**Senior Software Engineer** specializing in backend architecture, distributed systems, and platform reliability. I build scalable systems that improve latency, developer velocity, and production uptime.

Currently focused on event-driven architectures, observability at scale, and cross-functional technical leadership.

## 🎯 What I Do

- **Backend Architecture** — Designing resilient APIs, service boundaries, and data contracts for systems that scale
- **Platform Reliability** — Building observability and failure isolation so teams ship fast without breaking things
- **Technical Leadership** — Driving ambiguous initiatives from design to production across engineering, product, and ops

---

## 🚀 Notable Impact

- **~40% API latency reduction** on critical paths through caching, async workflows, and query optimization
- **~35% faster time-to-value** in customer onboarding via event-driven serverless architecture
- **Multi-fold throughput gains** on data-intensive clustering workloads through parallel execution backends
- **Improved release confidence** by establishing CI/CD automation, observability guardrails, and test coverage standards

## 💡 Beyond Code

I believe in **clear architecture decision records**, **shipping incrementally**, and **measuring what matters**. I mentor engineers through system design, code reviews, and debugging high-severity production incidents.

**Currently exploring:** Distributed tracing patterns, SLO-driven operations, and developer experience tooling.

**Reading now:** Deep Work (Cal Newport), Atomic Habits (James Clear), Essentialism (Greg McKeown)
